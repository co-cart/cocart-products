## Getting started

- [How to set up WooCommerce development environment](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/How-to-set-up-WooCommerce-development-environment)
- [String localization guidelines](#string-localization-guidelines)

## Coding Guidelines and Development ðŸ› 

- Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the `readme.txt` file.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the CoCart Products repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the CoCart team.

## Translating CoCart Products

CoCart Products can be translated on [translate.cocart.xyz](https://translate.cocart.xyz/projects/cocart-products/)

If CoCart Products is already 100% translated for your language, join the team anyway! Updates to the language files, and new strings that need translation will likely be added from time to time.

## String localization guidelines

 1. Use `cocart-products` textdomain in all strings.
 2. When using dynamic strings in printf/sprintf, if you are replacing > 1 string use numbered args. e.g. `Test %s string %s.` would be `Test %1$s string %2$s.`
 3. Use sentence case. e.g. `Some Thing` should be `Some thing`.
 4. Avoid HTML. If needed, insert the HTML using sprintf.
