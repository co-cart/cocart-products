This premium add-on provides a public version of accessing products, categories, tags, attributes and even reviews without the need to authenticate.

CoCart Products is a commercial plugin that is available from [https://cocart.xyz](https://cocart.xyz/add-ons/products/).

The plugin is hosted here on a public GitHub repository in order to better facilitate community contributions from developers and users alike.

If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to [submit it here](https://github.com/co-cart/cocart-products/issues/new).

I do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. I cannot provide support to anyone that does not hold a valid license key.

Thank you.
